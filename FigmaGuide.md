# From Design to Live Website: A Complete Workflow Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to go from an idea to a live website using Figma, GitHub, and VS Code. Think of it as a production line where your website evolves from design to reality.

## The Basic Workflow

### Step 1: Design in Figma
Start with Figma to create your website's visual design:
- Create an account at figma.com
- Start with a blank file
- Design your website's layout
- Get feedback from team members through Figma's commenting system

Think of Figma as your sketchpad where you can freely experiment with designs before committing to code.

### Step 2: From Design to Code
Once you're happy with a design in Figma:
- Open VS Code and your project
- Look at your Figma design
- Create the HTML structure first
- Add CSS styling to match your design
- Add any necessary TypeScript for interactions

This is like translating your blueprint (Figma) into actual building materials (code).

### Step 3: Testing and Deployment
Use GitHub Desktop to:
- Save your changes (commit)
- Upload to GitHub (push)
- See your changes live on GitHub Pages

## Real-world Example

Let's say you want to add a new events section:

1. **Design Phase**
   - Open Figma
   - Design how your events section should look
   - Share with your team for feedback
   - Iterate until everyone's happy

2. **Development Phase**
   - Open VS Code
   - Create new files in your project for the events section
   - Build the structure and styling
   - Test it locally using `npm start`

3. **Publication Phase**
   - Use GitHub Desktop to save and upload changes
   - Wait a few minutes
   - See your new section live on your website

## Tips for Success

### Design Tips
- Start simple in Figma
- Design for both desktop and mobile
- Use consistent colors and spacing
- Get feedback early

### Development Tips
- Keep Figma open while coding
- Build one section at a time
- Test frequently
- Commit changes regularly

### Collaboration Tips
- Use Figma comments for design feedback
- Use GitHub issues for development tasks
- Regular team check-ins
- Document your decisions

## Common Workflow Scenarios

### Making Small Text Changes
1. Update in Figma first
2. Make the change in VS Code
3. Push to GitHub

### Adding New Features
1. Design in Figma
2. Get team feedback
3. Build in VS Code
4. Test locally
5. Deploy through GitHub

### Handling Feedback
1. Collect feedback in Figma comments
2. Make design adjustments
3. Update code accordingly
4. Push changes

## Getting Started

1. Set up all three tools:
   - Figma account
   - GitHub Desktop
   - VS Code

2. Create your first design:
   - Start with your homepage
   - Keep it simple
   - Get comfortable with the tools

3. Begin the development:
   - Follow the design closely
   - Take it one component at a time
   - Regular commits and pushes

## Remember
- Design changes are easier in Figma than in code
- Always start with design before coding
- Regular commits keep your work safe
- Test thoroughly before pushing to live site

The key is to establish a rhythm: design → feedback → develop → test → deploy. Each tool has its purpose in this flow, and understanding how they work together will make your development process smoother.
